Hi there,

This is the test app. I spent about 7 hours to do it yesterday,  sorry about that, I think some code still can be optimised and improved. 
The main part is based on MVVM by using databinding + viewbinding + viewModel. The data retriveing part,  use okhttp+ retrofit2 + Gson to get and save the Json data.
